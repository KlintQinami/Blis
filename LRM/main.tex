\section{Introduction}

    Blis is a programming language for writing
    %
    hardware-accelerated 3D rendering programs. 
    %
    It gives the programmer fine-grained control of the 
    %
    graphics pipeline while abstracting away the burdensome 
    %
    details of OpenGL. The Blis philosophy is that OpenGL 
    %
    provides more power and flexibility than some graphics 
    %
    programmers will ever need. These OpenGL programmers are 
    %
    forced to write boilerplate code and painfully long 
    %
    programs to accomplish the simplest of tasks. By exposing %
    only the bare essentials of the graphics pipeline to the 
    %
    programmer,  Blis decreases the number of decisions that 
    %
    a graphics developer has to make. The result is sleek, 
    %
    novice-friendly code.
    %
    
    
    With Blis, you can write real-time 3D rendering programs 
    %
    such as 3D model viewers. You can write shadow maps for 
    %
    rendering dynamic shadows and use render-to-texture 
    %
    techniques to produce a variety of effects. In short, the 
    %
    idea is that you can write programs that manipulate Blis’
    %
    simplified graphics pipeline.
    
    
    In particular, writing vertex and fragment shaders is now more convenient. 
    %
    Rather than having to write shader code in a separate shader language 
    %
    (GLSL), you can use Blis to write both tasks that run on the GPU and those 
    %
    that run on the CPU. Consequently, shaders can reuse code from other parts 
    %
    of the program. Uniforms, attributes, and textures are registered with 
    %
    shaders by simply passing them as arguments into user-defined shader 
    %
    functions. Furthermore, loading shaders from the CPU to GPU is easily 
    %
    accomplished by uploading to a built-in pipeline object. See the “Parts of 
    %
    the Language” section below for more information about this pipeline object, %
    which is a central feature of Blis. 
    
    Blis has two backends: one for compiling source code to LLVM and another for %
    compiling to GLSL. The generated LLVM code links to the OpenGL library in 
    %
    order to make calls that access the GPU. 


\section{Sorts of programs to be written}
    Rendering is a major subtopic of 3D computer graphics, with many active 
    %
    researchers developing novel techniques for light transport modeling. These 
    %
    researchers would like to test their new ray tracing, ray casting, and 
    %
    rasterization developments by actual experimentation. These new methods would be 
    %
    translated into rendering programs written in our language. Because these 
    %
    programs would be written at a higher level of abstraction than OpenGL, they 
    %
    would resemble mathematical thinking and derivations. Our language would also 
    %
    facilitate users to make larger tweaks to their programs with fewer lines of 
    %
    code, allowing for a more effective use of their time in experimentation. 
    %
    Minimizing this transaction cost between research and code should allow for more 
    %
    development of rendering software overall.

    \end{itemize}
\fi

\section{Lexical Conventions}

For the most part, tokens in Blis are similar to C. The main difference is the extra keywords added to support vector and matrix types. There are four kinds of tokens: identifiers, keywords, literals, and expression operators like \code{(}, \code{)}, and \code{*}. Blis is a free-format language, so comments and whitespace are ignored except to separate tokens.

\subsection{Comments}

Blis has C-style comments, beginning with \code{/*} and ending with \code{*/} which do not nest. C++ style comments, beginning with \code{//} and extending to the end of the line, are also supported.

\subsection{Identifiers}

An identifier consists of an alphabetic character or underscore followed by a sequence of letters, digits, and underscores.

\subsection{Keywords}

The following identifiers are reserved as keywords, and may not be used as identifiers:

\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \code{int}
	\item \code{char}
	\item \code{float}
	\item \code{bool}
	\item \code{struct}
	\item \code{return}
	\item \code{break}
	\item \code{continue}
	\item \code{if}
	\item \code{else}
	\item \code{for}
	\item \code{while}
	\item \code{true}
	\item \code{false}
	\item \code{vec2}
	\item \code{vec3}
	\item \code{vec4}
	\item \code{mat2x2}
	\item \code{mat2x3}
	\item \code{mat2x4}
	\item \code{mat3x2}
	\item \code{mat3x3}
	\item \code{mat3x4}
	\item \code{mat4x2}
	\item \code{mat4x3}
	\item \code{mat4x4}
	\item \code{bvec2}
	\item \code{bvec3}
	\item \code{bvec4}
	\item \code{bmat2x2}
	\item \code{bmat2x3}
	\item \code{bmat2x4}
	\item \code{bmat3x2}
	\item \code{bmat3x3}
	\item \code{bmat3x4}
	\item \code{bmat4x2}
	\item \code{bmat4x3}
	\item \code{bmat4x4}
	\item \code{RGBA8}
	\item \code{RGB8}
	\item \code{RG8}
	\item \code{R8}
	\item \code{@vertex}
	\item \code{@fragment}

\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Literals}

\subsubsection{Integer Literals}

Integer literals consist of a sequence of one or more of the digits 0-9. Constants must be in decimal.

\subsubsection{Floating Point Literals}

A floating-point literal consists of an integer part, a decimal, a fractional part, and \code{e} followed by an optionally signed exponent. Both the integer and fractional parts consist of a sequence of digits. At least one of the integer and fractional parts must be present, and at least one of the decimal point and the exponent must be present. Since Blis only supports single-precision floating point, all floating point constants are considered single-precision.

\subsubsection{Character Literals} \label{charliterals}

A character literal consists of a single character, or a backslash followed by one of \code{'}, \code{n}, \code{r}, \code{t}, or a sequence of decimal digits that must form a number from 0 to 255 which represents an ASCII code. \code{'\textbackslash''}, \code{'\textbackslash{}n'}, \code{'\textbackslash{}r'}, and \code{'\textbackslash{}t'} have the usual meanings.

\subsubsection{Boolean Literals}

Boolean literals consist of the two keywords \code{true} and \code{false}.

\subsubsection{String Literals}

String literals consist of a series of characters surrounded by \code{"}. All the escapes described in section~\ref{charliterals} are supported, as well as \code{\textbackslash{}"} to escape a \code{"}. String literals have type \code{char[n]}, i.e. a fixed-size array of characters where \code{n} is the number of characters. For example, \code{"Hello world"} has type \code{char[11]}. Unlike C, there is no extra \code{'\textbackslash{}0'} inserted at the end of the string.

\section{Syntax and Semantics}

\subsection{Basic Types}

\subsubsection{Integers}

Blis supports integers through the \code{int} type, which is a 32-bit two's-complement signed integer type.

\subsubsection{Characters}

Blis supports characters through the \code{char} type, which is an 8-bit unsigned integer type.

\subsubsection{Floating Point}

Blis supports single-precision (32-bit) floating point numbers through the \code{float} type.

\subsubsection{Booleans}

Blis supports booleans through the \code{bool} type. Booleans may only ever be \code{true} or \code{false}.

\subsection{Vectors and Matrices}

To more easily represent position data and color data, Blis supports vectors and matrices of floating-point numbers with the \code{vec2}, \code{vec3}, and \code{vec4} builtin types, as well as \code{matNxM} where  $1 \leq \code{N} \leq 4$ and $1 \leq \code{M} \leq 4$, similar to GLSL. Blis supports the full complement of matrix-vector multiplication operations on these types as described in section~\ref{operators}, as well as component-wise multiplication and a number of built-in functions described in section~\ref{builtins}.

Blis also supports vectors and matrices of boolean type, denoted by \code{bvec2}, \code{bmat2x2}, etc., which are the result of the comparison operators \code{==}, \code{!=}, \code{>}, \code{<}, \code{>=}, and \code{<=} applied to floating-point vectors and matrices. The builtin functions \code{all()} and \code{any()} can be used to reduce these types to a single boolean value, so that e.g. \code{all(foo == bar)} checks that all the components of \code{foo} and \code{bar} are equal.

In addition to the special operators and built-in functions, \code{vecN} types have \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{z}, and \code{w} members as appropriate as if they were normal structures, and \code{matNxM} types have \code{xx}, \code{xy}, \code{yx}, etc. Thus, the syntax to access the \code{x} component of a \code{vec4 foo} is \code{foo.x}. This also applies to the boolean vector and matrix types.

\subsection{Packed Types}

Oftentimes, when handling large amounts of data, we want to store a more compact representation of the data in order to reduce bandwidth and memory requirements. For example, color data is often stored using 8 bits per channel since a larger color depth wouldn't cause any noticeable increase in quality. Conceptually, each 8-bit channel represents a luminance value between 0 (minimum luminance) and 1 (maximum luminance), with 0 mapping to 0 and 255 mapping to 1. GPU's even include special support for packed formats like these, being able to sample from an image of packed data and convert it on the fly to floating point, or vice versa, quantizing a floating-point output to a packed format when writing to an image. To support this use-case, Blis has special packed types such as \code{RGBA8} which are described in the table below. These types are implicitly convertible to and from the appropriate vector type (given in the following table), but converting from the vector type to the packed type will obviously involve some loss of data. The conversion may happen on the CPU, or for operations involving the GPU, it may happen automatically through OpenGL.

\vspace{3mm}

\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
\hline
Packed Type & Vector Type & Packed to Vector & Vector to Packed \\
\hline
\code{RGBA8} & \code{vec4} & $\textit{val} / 255$ & $ \lfloor \text{min}(\text{max}(\textit{val}, 1), 0) \cdot 255 \rfloor$ \\
\hline
\code{RGB8} & \code{vec3} & $\textit{val} / 255$ & $ \lfloor \text{min}(\text{max}(\textit{val}, 1), 0) \cdot 255 \rfloor$ \\
\hline
\code{RG8} & \code{vec2} & $\textit{val} / 255$ & $ \lfloor \text{min}(\text{max}(\textit{val}, 1), 0) \cdot 255 \rfloor$ \\
\hline
\code{R8} & \code{float} & $\textit{val} / 255$ & $ \lfloor \text{min}(\text{max}(\textit{val}, 1), 0) \cdot 255 \rfloor$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Arrays}

Blis supports one and two-dimensional arrays of fixed and variable size. An array of \code{foo}'s is denoted as \code{foo[N]}, where \code{N} is an integer literal, or \code{foo[]} for a runtime-sized array. Two-dimensional runtime-sized arrays are denoted by \code{foo[,]} or \code{foo[N,]} where \code{N} is an integer literal. If the outer dimension is omitted, then it is sized at runtime as well. The reason for including two-dimensional runtime-sized arrays explicitly, rather than using \code{foo[][]}, is that \code{foo[][]} is semantically different from \code{foo[,]} --- a variable of the former type can have elements of the outer array with different sizes, while the latter is a two dimensional array where all the inner arrays must have the same size. The latter type construction, when combined with packed types, is useful for representing images whose width and height are only known at runtime; for example, a \code{loadImage()} routine would probably return a value of type \code{RGBA8[,]} or \code{RGB8[,]}.

Although constant values of type \code{foo[,]} cannot be constructed directly, values of type \code{foo[N][M]} can be implicitly converted to \code{foo[,]} as described in section~\ref{conversions}. Arrays of type \code{foo[N]} can be constructed by giving a comma-separated list of \code{N} values enclosed by \code{[} and \code{]}. For example,

\begin{lstlisting}
vec3[3] bar = [vec3(0., 0., 1.), vec3(0., 1., 0.), vec3(1., 0., 0.)];
\end{lstlisting}

Note that, due to implicit conversions, the following would also work:

\begin{lstlisting}
vec3[] bar = [vec3(0., 0., 1.), vec3(0., 1., 0.), vec3(1., 0., 0.)];
\end{lstlisting}

although the resulting \code{bar} would have a different type. However, none of the elements of the list being constructed can have different types; that is, implicit type conversion doesn't happen across array members.

\subsection{Structures}

Blis supports structures, similar to C, for storing multiple values together. Structures are declared with a syntax similar to C's, for example:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct {
	vec3 a;
	float[3] b;
} MyStruct;
\end{lstlisting}

However, referring to the type \code{MyStruct} does not require the \code{struct} keyword:

\begin{lstlisting}
MyStruct foo;
MyStruct makeMyStruct(int a, float[3] b);
\end{lstlisting}

This gives the compiler the flexibility to use the \code{struct} mechanism internally to create various built-in types, like \code{vec3}, \code{window}, etc.

Values of a given structure type can be created by using the identifier, followed by a \code{\{}, then a comma-separated list of values and a closing \code{\}}. For example:

\begin{lstlisting}
MyStruct foo = MyStruct {
	vec3(0., 0., 0.),
	[0., 0., 1.]
};
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Type Conversions} \label{conversions}

There are a few cases in Blis where one type can be an acceptable substitute for another, namely, sized vs. unsized arrays and packed types, and the type conversion happens implicitly. Generally, it is assumed that one type, known through the rest of the rules, needs to be converted to another type which is also known beforehand; in cases where this might not be true, the rule to follow is called out explicitly. A type \textit{A} can be converted to another type \textit{B} if:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{A} and \textit{B} are already the same type.
	\item \textit{A} is a packed type and \textit{B} is its corresponding vector type, or vice versa.
	\item \textit{A} is of type \code{\textit{C}[N][M]} or \code{\textit{C}[N,]} and \textit{B} is of type \code{\textit{D}[N,]} or \code{\textit{D}[,]} and \textit{C} can be converted to \textit{D}.
	\item \textit{A} is of type \code{\textit{C}[N]} and \textit{B} is of type \code{\textit{D}[N]} or \code{\textit{D}[]} and \textit{C} can be converted to \textit{D}.
\end{itemize}

Note that if \textit{A} and \textit{B} are both struct types, then for them to be the same type, they must have the same name; that is, structure  equality is by name, not structural. Also, this relation is not symmetric (for example, \code{float[5]} can be converted to \code{float[]} but not vice versa), but it is transitive, and of course it is reflexive.

There are also the usual explicit type conversions. Similar to GLSL, they use the function call syntax. Thus, you can do:

\begin{lstlisting}
float foo = float(42);
float bar = float(true); // returns 1.0
int bar = int(false); // returns 0
\end{lstlisting}

The full complement of 6 conversions amongst \code{float}, \code{int}, and \code{bool} is provided with the usual meaning, except for converting to \code{bool} which can be done through comparing with 0. Also, \code{char} can be be converted to \code{int} and vice versa, with the latter reinterpreting the \code{int} as unsigned and taking the lowest 8 bits.

\subsection{Operators} \label{operators}

The operators supported by Blis, taken from GLSL, are:

\vspace{3mm}
