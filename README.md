# Blis:  Better Language for Image Stuff
Blis is a programming language for writing hardware-accelerated 3D rendering programs. 
It gives the programmer fine-grained control of the graphics pipeline while
abstracting away the burdensome details of OpenGL. The Blis philosophy is that
OpenGL provides more power and flexibility than some graphics programmers will
ever need. These OpenGL programmers are forced to write boilerplate code and
painfully long programs to accomplish the simplest of tasks. By exposing only the
bare essentials of the graphics pipeline to the programmer, Blis decreases the number
of decisions that a graphics developer has to make. The result is sleek, novice-friendly
code.
