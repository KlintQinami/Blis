\section{Introduction}

    Blis is a programming language for writing
    %
    hardware-accelerated 3D rendering programs. 
    %
    It gives the programmer fine-grained control of the 
    %
    graphics pipeline while abstracting away the burdensome 
    %
    details of OpenGL. The Blis philosophy is that OpenGL 
    %
    provides more power and flexibility than some graphics 
    %
    programmers will ever need. These OpenGL programmers are 
    %
    forced to write boilerplate code and painfully long 
    %
    programs to accomplish the simplest of tasks. By exposing %
    only the bare essentials of the graphics pipeline to the 
    %
    programmer,  Blis decreases the number of decisions that 
    %
    a graphics developer has to make. The result is sleek, 
    %
    novice-friendly code.
    %
    
    
    With Blis, you can write real-time 3D rendering programs 
    %
    such as 3D model viewers. You can write shadow maps for 
    %
    rendering dynamic shadows and use render-to-texture 
    %
    techniques to produce a variety of effects. In short, the 
    %
    idea is that you can write programs that manipulate Blis’
    %
    simplified graphics pipeline.
    
    
    In particular, writing vertex and fragment shaders is now more convenient. 
    %
    Rather than having to write shader code in a separate shader language 
    %
    (GLSL), you can use Blis to write both tasks that run on the GPU and those 
    %
    that run on the CPU. Consequently, shaders can reuse code from other parts 
    %
    of the program. Uniforms, attributes, and textures are registered with 
    %
    shaders by simply passing them as arguments into user-defined shader 
    %
    functions. Furthermore, loading shaders from the CPU to GPU is easily 
    %
    accomplished by uploading to a built-in pipeline object. See the “Parts of 
    %
    the Language” section below for more information about this pipeline object, %
    which is a central feature of Blis. 
    
    Blis has two backends: one for compiling source code to LLVM and another for %
    compiling to GLSL. The generated LLVM code links to the OpenGL library in 
    %
    order to make calls that access the GPU. 


\section{Sorts of programs to be written}
    Rendering is a major subtopic of 3D computer graphics, with many active 
    %
    researchers developing novel techniques for light transport modeling. These 
    %
    researchers would like to test their new ray tracing, ray casting, and 
    %
    rasterization developments by actual experimentation. These new methods would be 
    %
    translated into rendering programs written in our language. Because these 
    %
    programs would be written at a higher level of abstraction than OpenGL, they 
    %
    would resemble mathematical thinking and derivations. Our language would also 
    %
    facilitate users to make larger tweaks to their programs with fewer lines of 
    %
    code, allowing for a more effective use of their time in experimentation. 
    %
    Minimizing this transaction cost between research and code should allow for more 
    %
    development of rendering software overall.


\section{Parts of the language and what they do}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data types: Integers (int), floating point numbers (float), single and multidimensional arrays, matrices (up to 4x4) (matrix), strings (string) -- for file I/O and writing
        \item  Built-in cos, sin, exp, and log functions
        \item  Loops (for and while), if and else statements
        \item  User-defined functions
        \item  Comments
        \item  Buffer/Image opaque types for data on the GPU
            \begin{itemize}
            \item Represent data stored on the GPU
            \item Only way to interact is through uploading/downloading to arrays
            \end{itemize}
        \item Shaders
            \begin{itemize}
            \item Functions annotated for use on the GPU
            \item Arguments represent resources 
            \end{itemize}
        \item Pipeline built-in type for actual rendering
            \begin{itemize}
                \item  Can “bind” shaders, buffers and images to the pipeline for use as inputs/outputs
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

     * interpolated across the triangle, called a “varying”

     * determines where the triangle is rendered.

     * the color of the “fragment” (potential pixel).

        return color;

     * color and depth.

                        vec3(0.0,  1.0, 0.0)])

/* this creates a window and the framebuffer for it */
Window my_window = make_window(1024, 768, “My Window”);

/* tell the pipeline to draw to the window’s framebuffer */

    angle += 1.0;
